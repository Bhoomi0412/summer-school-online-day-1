Here is a documentation file:-

1.What each HTML element does ?

<h1> to <h6> - Define headings from largest (h1) to smallest (h6).
<p> - Defines a paragraph of text.
<a> - Creates a hyperlink to another page or website.
<img> - Embeds an image and supports alt text for accessibility.
<ul> - Creates an unordered list (bullet points).
<ol> - Creates an ordered list (numbered items).
<li> - Defines each item inside a list.
<table> - Used to display data in rows and columns.
<form> - Wraps all input fields for user data submission.
<input> - Creates input fields (text, email, date, etc.).
<textarea> - Allows users to type a multi-line message.
<select> - A dropdown menu for choosing one option.
<option> - Defines each choice inside a <select>.
<nav> - Represents the site navigation area.
<header> - Represents the top section of a page.
<main> - Represents the main content area.
<section> - Groups related content on a page.
<footer> - Represents the bottom section of a page.

2. Why I chose specific input types ?

<input type="text"> is used for general text input like a name.
<input type="email"> validates the email format automatically.
<input type="tel"> is used for phone numbers, with a pattern to allow only digits.
<textarea> is ideal for longer messages because it supports multiple lines.
<select> lets users pick from a list of topics easily.
<input type="date"> gives users a calendar to select a date.
<input type="range"> allows users to slide and choose a level (like urgency).
Validation attributes like required and pattern help make sure correct data is entered.

3. How my navigation structure works ?

I placed a <nav> element inside the <header> of each page to provide a consistent navigation menu.
It includes links to all three pages: portfolio.html (Home), about.html (About), and contact.html (Contact).
The links are relative and work within the same folder. This helps users move easily between different sections of my website.
